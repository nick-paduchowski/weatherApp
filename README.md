# Weather App

## About

This is a very basic weather app I have built which uses the OpenWeatherMap API to grab climate information for a user entered city. The default city is set to Toronto. 

<strong>Please note: this application will not work out of the box if downloaded from this repository. You must edit the JavaScript file to include your own API key for the OpenWeatherMap API</strong>
